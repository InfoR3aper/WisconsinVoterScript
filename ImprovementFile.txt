Notes on program limitations:

Search and Find outline (have to be inputting a list). More broadly, will be limited by search and find design choices, meant to output a report for one Rep.

Incredibly hack and slashed. Elegant if you donâ€™t look at it.

No ability to select what information you want, aside from commenting out methods.

Only ability to reliably count votes comes down to only counting votes for Towns and Villages as a whole. The spreadsheets from GAB irregularly labeled these and I am not smart enough to fix it.

SLOW. I could use help here.

Limited object-oriented implementation.
