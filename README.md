# WisconsinVoterScript
Script that writes, tabulates, and outputs statistics about Wisconsin voting patterns.

This script arose out of my time spent in a local government office. Lots of data is published from the Wisconsin GAB (http://www.gab.wi.gov/), but isn't consistently formatted in order to be useful. I wrote a script that took the raw .xls file from the website, wrote it into a consistent format, and then read that consistent format. My script only wrote the information from the raw sheet that I cared about, ie -- Ward #, votes, and party. 

I've also attached the folders containing the raw data from the GAB (labeled Raw) and the folders containing the compiled data that was written by my "Write" class (labeled Compiled).
